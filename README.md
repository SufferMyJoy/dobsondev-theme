# DobsonDev WordPress Theme

This project is the WordPress theme for my website [DobsonDev.com](http://dobsondev.com). The theme can be applied to any WordPress installation, but be aware that the commenting system is different than that on [DobsonDev](http://dobsondev.com). The commenting system on my [DobsonDev](http://dobsondev.com) was made entirely by me and made to look and function differently than the WordPress commenting system. I am actively working to move the commenting system to be an installable plugin, but it has not reached that point yet.

*NOTE:* I'm quite new to the whole design game and I do a lot more backend work. I think everything in here is quite organized and up to standards and all that, but you never know!

## Installation & Basic Setup
To install This theme, you should unzip the package locally, then upload the **dobsondev-theme** folder to your WP site (via FTP):

It is highly recommended to use the supplied child theme so you don't lose changes.

An child theme is included called **dobsondev-child**. Simply upload that folder to your WP site the same way you did the primary **dobsondev-theme** folder.

Your final theme directory structure should include both **wp-content/themes/dobsondev-theme** and **wp-content/themes/dobsondev-child**

Activate **dobsondev-child** from Appearance -> Themes and enjoy.
